This repository contains three projects applying data mining techniques to CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) and insulin datasets.

Extracting Time Series Project
    Goal: Extract several performance metrics of an Artificial Pancreas system from
    sensor data. Process raw CGM and Insulin data to extract time-series features.  

Machine Model Training Project 
    Goal: Train dataset to train and test a machine model.

Cluster Validation Project
    Goal: Apply cluster validation techniques to data extracted from a dataset.
